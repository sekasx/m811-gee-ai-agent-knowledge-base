#### Description



The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital
elevation dataset was originally produced to provide consistent,
high\-quality elevation data at near global scope. This version
of the SRTM digital elevation data has been processed to fill data
voids, and to facilitate its ease of use.
