#### Description



After 2022\-01\-25, Sentinel\-2 scenes with PROCESSING\_BASELINE '04\.00' or above
have their DN (value) range shifted by 1000\. The HARMONIZED collection
shifts data in newer scenes to be in the same range as in older scenes.


Sentinel\-2 is a wide\-swath, high\-resolution, multi\-spectral
imaging mission supporting Copernicus Land Monitoring studies,
including the monitoring of vegetation, soil and water cover,
as well as observation of inland waterways and coastal areas.


The Sentinel\-2 L2 data are downloaded from CDSE. They were
computed by running sen2cor. WARNING: 2017\-2018 L2 coverage
in the EE collection is not yet global.


The assets contain
12 UINT16 spectral bands representing SR scaled by 10000 (unlike in L1 data,
there is no B10\). There are also several more L2\-specific bands (see band
list for details). See the
[Sentinel\-2 User Handbook](https://sentinel.esa.int/documents/247904/685211/Sentinel-2_User_Handbook)
for details.


QA60 is a bitmask band that contained rasterized cloud mask
polygons until 2022\-01\-25, when these polygons stopped being produced.
Starting 2024\-02\-28, legacy\-consistent QA60 bands are constructed from
the MSK\_CLASSI cloud classification bands.
For more details,
[see the full explanation of how cloud masks are computed.](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/technical-guides/sentinel-2-msi/level-1c/cloud-masks)


EE asset ids for Sentinel\-2 L2 assets have the following format:
COPERNICUS/S2\_SR/20151128T002653\_20151128T102149\_T56MNN. Here the
first numeric part represents the sensing date and time, the
second numeric part represents the product generation date and
time, and the final 6\-character string is a unique granule identifier
indicating its UTM grid reference (see [MGRS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Grid_Reference_System)).


For datasets to assist with cloud and/or cloud shadow detection, see [COPERNICUS/S2\_CLOUD\_PROBABILITY](/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2_CLOUD_PROBABILITY)
and [GOOGLE/CLOUD\_SCORE\_PLUS/V1/S2\_HARMONIZED](/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GOOGLE_CLOUD_SCORE_PLUS_V1_S2_HARMONIZED).
