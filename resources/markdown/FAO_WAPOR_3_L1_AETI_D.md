#### Description



The actual evapotranspiration and interception (ETIa) (dekadal, in mm/day)
is the sum of the soil evaporation (E), canopy transpiration (T), and
evaporation from rainfall intercepted by leaves (I). The value of each pixel
represents the average daily ETIa in a given dekad.

### Terms of Use


**Terms of Use**


The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is
mandated to collect, analyze, interpret, and disseminate information related
to nutrition, food, and agriculture. In this regard, it publishes a number
of databases on topics related to FAO's mandate, and encourages the use of
them for scientific and research purposes. Consistent with the principles
of openness and sharing envisioned under the [Open Data Licensing For
Statistical Databases](http://www.fao.org/3/ca7570en/ca7570en.pdf), and
consistent with the mandate of FAO, data from the [Water Productivity Open
Access Portal (WaPOR)](https://www.fao.org/in-action/remote-sensing-for-water-productivity/wapor-data-access/en), as part
of [AQUASTAT](http://www.fao.org/aquastat/en/) \- FAO's Global Information
System on Water and Agriculture, is available free to the user community.
