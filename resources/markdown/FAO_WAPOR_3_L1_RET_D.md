#### Description



Reference evapotranspiration (RET) is defined as the evapotranspiration from a
hypothetical reference crop and it simulates the behaviour of a well\-watered
grass surface. The value of each pixel represents the average of the daily
reference evapotranspiration for that specific dekad.
