#### Description



The Harmonized Landsat Sentinel\-2 (HLS) project provides consistent surface
reflectance data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the joint
NASA/USGS Landsat 8 satellite and the Multi\-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard
Europe's Copernicus Sentinel\-2A satellites. The combined
measurement enables global observations of the land every 2\-3 days at
30\-meter (m) spatial resolution.
The HLS project uses a set of algorithms
to obtain seamless products from OLI and MSI that include atmospheric
correction, cloud and cloud\-shadow masking, spatial co\-registration and
common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization, and spectral
bandpass adjustment.


The HLS project distributes data as two separate products: HLSL30
(Landsat 8/9\) and HLSS30 (Sentinel\-2 A/B). They both provide 30m Nadir
Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF), Adjusted Reflectance
(NBAR).
