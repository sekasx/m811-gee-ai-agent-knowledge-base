#### Description



The GAP/LANDFIRE National Terrestrial Ecosystems data represents a detailed
vegetation and land cover classification for the Conterminous U.S., Alaska,
Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.GAP/LF 2011 Ecosystems for the Conterminous U.S. is
an update of the National Gap Analysis Program Land Cover Data \- Version 2\.2\.
Alaska ecosystems have been updated by LANDFIRE to 2012 conditions (LANDFIRE 2012\).
Hawaii and Puerto Rico data represent the 2001 time\-frame (Gon et al. 2006, Gould et al. 2008\).
The classification scheme used for the Alaska and the lower 48 states is based
on NatureServe's Ecological System Classification (Comer et al. 2003\), while
Puerto Rico and Hawaii's map legend are based on island specific classification
systems (Gon et al. 2006, Gould et al. 2008\).
