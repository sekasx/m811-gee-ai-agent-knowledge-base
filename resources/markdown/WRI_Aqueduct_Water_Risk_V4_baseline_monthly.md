#### Description



Aqueduct 4\.0 is the latest iteration of WRI's water risk framework designed
to translate complex hydrological data into intuitive indicators of water
related risk. This dataset has curated 13 water risk indicators for
quantity, quality and reputational concerns into a comprehensive framework.
For 5 of the 13 indicators, a global hydrological model called PCR\-GLOBWB 2
has been used to generate novel datasets on sub\-basic water supply.
The PCR\-GLOBWB 2 model is also used to project future sub\-basin water
conditions using CMIP6 climate forcings. The projections center around
three periods (2030, 2050, and 2080\) under three future scenarios
(business\-as\-usual SSP 3 RCP 7\.0, optimistic SSP 1 RCP 2\.6, and
pessimistic SSP 5 RCP 8\.5\).


The water risk indicators have been aggregated by category (quantity,
quality, reputational, and overall) into composite risk scores using
sector\-specific weighting schemes. In addition, select sub\-basin scores have
been aggregated into country and provincial administrative boundaries using
a weighted average approach, where sub\-basins with more demand have a higher
influence over the final administrative score.


The WRI Aqueduct baseline monthly dataset provides monthly data on key water
risk indicators which includes indicators such as baseline water stress,
baseline water depletion and interannual variability.This monthly data
allows for a more detailed analysis of water risk dynamics throughout the
year, which is crucial for understanding seasonal water scarcity, planning
for water management interventions, and adapting to changing water
availability patterns.


This [technical note](https://www.wri.org/research/aqueduct-40-updated-decision-relevant-global-water-risk-indicators)
explains in detail the framework, methodology, and data used
in developing Aqueduct Floods.
