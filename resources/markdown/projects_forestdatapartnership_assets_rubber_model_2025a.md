#### Description



**Note: This dataset is not yet peer\-reviewed. Please see this
[GitHub README](https://github.com/google/forest-data-partnership/tree/main/models)
for more information.**


This image collection provides estimated per\-pixel probability that the
underlying area is occupied by the commodity. The probability estimates are
provided at 10 meter resolution, and have been generated by a machine
learning model. For details, see the technical documentation on the
[Forest Data Partnership repo](https://github.com/google/forest-data-partnership/tree/main)
on Github.


The primary purpose of this image collection is to support the mission of
the [Forest Data Partnership](https://www.forestdatapartnership.org/) which
aims to halt and reverse forest loss from commodity production by
collaboratively improving global monitoring, supply chain tracking, and
restoration.


This dataset currently covers the following countries: Thailand, Indonesia,
Viet Nam, Côte d'Ivoire, China, Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico, and Sri Lanka.


This community data product is meant to evolve over time, as more data
becomes available from the community and the model used to produce the maps
continuously improves. If you would like to provide general feedback or
additional datasets to improve these layers, please reach out through
[this form](https://goo.gle/fdap-data).


Limitations: Model output is limited to selected countries as calendar year
composites for 2020 and 2023\. Not all regions of the output are well
represented by training data. Accuracy is reported in aggregate, and will
vary geographically and with user chosen thresholds. Sensor artifacts based
on data availability, cross\-track nonuniformity, or cloudiness may be
visually apparent in output probabilities and result in classification
errors at some thresholds.


**Note that this dataset has separate terms of use for commercial users of
Earth Engine. Please see "Terms of Use" tab for details.**
